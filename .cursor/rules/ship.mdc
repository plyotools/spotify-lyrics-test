# Ship Command Rules

## "Ship It" Behavior

When the user says "ship it" or uses `/ship`:

1. **Pre-ship Checks**:
   - Ensure project is synced with Control Center (rules and ports up to date)
   - Run tests if test script exists
   - Build project if build script exists

2. **Git Operations**:
   - Check git status
   - Stage all changes
   - Create commit with appropriate message (or ask user for message)
   - Push to existing remote (if configured)

3. **No Repository Creation**:
   - "Ship it" does NOT create new GitHub repositories
   - It only pushes to existing remotes
   - Use "release it" for repository creation

4. **Standard Scripts**:
   - Use `npm run ship` if it exists (may include test + build + push)
   - Otherwise, perform git operations directly

5. **Error Handling**:
   - If remote doesn't exist, inform user they need to "release it" first
   - If authentication fails, inform user to check Control Center GitHub config

## Ship Script Template

The Control Center provides a standard `ship` script that:
- Runs tests (if available)
- Builds the project (if build script exists)
- Commits and pushes changes

Projects can customize this script as needed.
